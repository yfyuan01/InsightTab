**Response to Reviewer1**

We sincerely thank the reviewer for the suggestions and below please find our response

$\underline{Response \space to \space the \space weaknesses}$

1. We thank the reviewer for their suggestion to change the naming of the task from "few-shot tabular classification" to "prompt-based tabular classification algorithms." We would like to clarify that our method emphasizes a training-free, LLM-based approach, particularly suited for low-resource, few-shot settings. We use the term "few-shot tabular classification" following terminology from related works [1, 2] to maintain consistency with existing literature. While we acknowledge the rich literature of research on self-supervised learning and Bayesian methods that achieve strong performance on benchmark datasets, our focus is on the advantages of LLMs in this context. Specifically, existing work [1] has already verified that LLMs excel in scenarios with **little** or **no** labeled training data, offering strong performance with minimal reliance on extensive training. The core benefit of LLM-based, prompt-driven approaches is their reduced training overhead, as performance can be optimized primarily through effective prompting strategies, saving substantial time in the classification process. Additionally, LLM-based methods demonstrate practical advantages in real-world applications, particularly by addressing bias and safety concerns without requiring full data visibility. We will revise the Introduction, Related Work, and Experimental Setup sections in our next version to clarify these points and further strengthen the paper.

2. We thank the reviewer for the insightful feeback regarding the motivation of the prompting strategy. The motivation of such serialization consists several aspects and is supported by various previous works[1,2,3]: (1) while converting prompt-based inputs into structured formats for XGBoost is a valid approach, it introduces an additional step of transformation, potentially losing important contextual nuances that LLMs are designed to capture. (2) the design of combining XGBoost and LLM serialization involves factors such as flexibility and the ability of LLMs to generalize across tasks, as LLMs provide a unified framework that reduces the need for task-specific transformations. (3) This approach is more advantageous when few/no samples are provided, given LLMs' remarkable ability in terms of language understanding.
   
3. Given the page and resource constraints of this paper, we respectfully argue that conducting experiments on the full dataset (30-40 instances) is challenging. Therefore, we follow previous works [1] and use the 9 most representative datasets with different scale to show the effectiveness of our method (the reason for selecting these datasets see our 3rd response in the next section).

$\underline{Response \space to \space the \space questions}$
1. While we agree that SSL-based methods can be applied to tabular classification, we emphasize that our focus is on the low-resource, few-shot setting where LLMs can be particularly effective. Bayesian algorithms, therefore, fall outside the scope of this work. However, for the reviewer's reference, we have included the results of TabPFN and XGBoost below (see **Table 1**). Our method demonstrates a clear advantage when applied to small training datasets, further validating its effectiveness in the targeted **few-shot** setting.

2. We agree with the reviewer's concern about directly using XGBoost on each dataset. However, **since we are not the first to use LLMs for the tabular classificatio task, existing works have already made such comparison and verify the advantage of using LLM as a serialization tool against XGBoost (see Table 1 in [1])**. Therefore, we didn't report this result for space constraints. However, we attach the result below. We will add the results in our next version.

2.5. the reasoing for using an LLM over XGBoost in our task has several key points: (1) LLMs are designed to understand complex relationships in data, in cases where the tabular data is represented in a natural language-like format (such as serialized descriptions or feature-rich text), LLMs can exploit their pre-trained knowledge to extract deeper, contextual insights that a traditional algorithm like XGBoost might miss. (2) LLMs provide a more unified approach and allows for end-to-end training. This reduces the complexity of the pipeline. (3) LLMs come with pre-trained knowledge that allows them to generalize across domains, this improves the model's adaptability and generatilization ability. (4) LLMs are especially good at learning in a low-resourse scenario, which allows for training-free few-shot classification.

3. Due to budget constraints (particularly with closed-source LLMs like GPT) and time limitations, running the algorithm on the entire benchmark is challenging. Instead, we selected 9 datasets and evaluated 2 different LLMs to demonstrate the generalizability of our method. For dataset selection, we followed the approach outlined in [1] to ensure a fair comparison. According to Section 4.1 in [1], the 9 datasets are selected for the following reasons: (1) datasets with at most 50,000 rows to keep the fine-tuning costs manageable and at most 30 columns to stay within T0â€™s token limit. (2) textual feature names are required to make the serializations more meaningful (3) datasets with derived feature values are excluded. 

4. The code is currently hosted in a private GitHub repository. While we are unable to release it at this time due to safety concerns, we have included the specific prompts used in our experiments in the paper to ensure reproducibility. We will release the code as soon as our paper gets accepted.

**We thank the reviewer again for the suggestions. We will add more elaborations and experimental results concerning the problems discussed. We sincerely hope the reviewer can kindly reassess the score if he/she finds our response helpful.**

1. We appreciate the reviewer's observation concerning the performance decreases with an increased number of few-shot samples. We agree that it is be a noteworthy aspect of our current framework. However, we believe this phenomenon does not necessarily indicate an inherent limitation of the framework in benefiting from larger datasets. Rather, it may be attributed to several factors: (1) This phenomenon can occur due to the inherent characteristics of LLM-based, prompt-driven methods, which may not benefit from larger data scales in the same way as traditional machine learning models. (2) as our setting is designed to simulate scenarios with very limited data, when more data is added incrementally, the framework might require adjustments (such as regularization or fine-tuning strategies) to fully leverage the larger sample size. We will add more clarification in our next version. 

2. We acknowledge that using a stronger LLM provides an advantage in rule summarization. To address the concern, we've added our experimental results with other rule LLMs below (see **Table 1**). We find our experiments with weaker LLMs like Mistral and gpt-4o-mini still demonstrate promising performance, as they retain the ability to generalize key patterns, even if their summarization capabilities are less robust. In addition, we agree that generalizing to more complex problems, where rules cannot be explicitly summarized, presents a challenge. Nevertheless, for harder tasks, we envision LLMs functioning in a more iterative mode, where they gather contextual information over multiple steps or turns from the selected examples, rather than relying solely on summarizing predefined rules.

**Response to Reviewer3**

We sincerely thank the reviewer for the suggestions and below please find our response

$\underline{Response \space to \space the \space weaknesses}$

1. We acknowledge that our framework does not explicitly incorporate the standard 'chain-of-thought' reasoning. However, we kindly argue that both the summarization and reflection mechanisms in our approach serve as forms of reasoning. Summarization allows the model to extract high-level, condensed rules from the dataset, which aids in better understanding the underlying patterns. Similarly, reflection functions as another type of reasoning, enabling the model to revisit and gain insights from samples that are prone to misclassification, thereby enhancing its ability to learn from mistakes. These mechanisms, while differing from traditional chain-of-thought reasoning, provide a powerful means for the model to process and analyze information in a structured way.

2. We quantify the "difficulty of prediction" by calculating the entropy generated by XGBoost for each data sample. Specifically, we rank the samples based on entropy scores, designating the $n_e$ samples with lowest entropy scores as easy and $n_h$ samples with highest entropy scores as difficult samples. For the reflection process, we test the prediction LLM by demonstrating easy samples and then applying it to hard samples. Misclassified hard samples are selected for further reflection, where the model learns a corrective rule to improve its performance.
   
3. We apologize for not reporting the computational cost for the proposed method due to page limit. Concerning the computation cost of the framework when the dataset has a large scale, while the three-step process of grouping, ranking, and summarizing might introduce some computational overhead, our design prioritizes efficiency and flexibility for the following reasons: (1) **Efficient Sampling**: instead of processing all data points, InsightTab can operate on representative samples, reducing the overall cost while still maintaining accuracy. (2) **Parallelization**: some steps of the framework can be parallized, which helps reduce the overall time consumption. For example, the grouping and ranking steps can be parallelized, making it feasible to scale InsightTab to larger datasets without significantly increasing computation time. (3) **Incremental Summarization**: for continuous or streaming data, InsightTab can summarize data incrementally rather than processing the entire dataset at once, reducing memory and computational burdens. (4) **Training-free solution**: although two LLMs are utilized in the framework, this does not imply that computational cost is a significant concern. Both LLMs are employed in a training-free manner, allowing for API-based methods that significantly reduce the overhead typically associated with model training. Therefore, we believe our method still shows advantage in terms of larger scale or more complicated scenarios. (We attach the overall cost below in **Table 1** to further address the reviewer's concern). We see our method shows advantage against other LLM prompt-based method (SummaryBoost as the most state-of-the-art) both in terms of time and budget cost. 

4. We acknowledge that the performance of our framework can be influenced by the limitations of the LLMs used. However, our goal is to reduce full dependency on LLMs by combining their strong language understanding with traditional machine learning techniques. Our approach leverages the strengths of LLMs in interpreting natural language descriptions of features, summarizing complex patterns, and serializing features into natural language sentences, without relying solely on them for computation. While LLMs may face challenges with intricate tabular data structures, our framework mitigates this by integrating the grouping, ranking, and summarization steps, which uncover relationships between features, even in complex tabular formats. To further assess InsightTab's versatility, we conducted experiments on 9 different tasks, demonstrating its ability to handle various data formats effectively.

1. Please kindly see our response to reviewer1 (Response to Weakness 1 and Response to Question 2 & 2.5).
   
2. We acknowledge the concern of rule example size, we will add a limitation section to discuss about it in detail. However, we propose two potential strategies to mitigate the issue: (1) Chunking and batching. Instead of inputting all examples at once, we can split the data into smaller chunks or batches that stay within the context length limit. The LLM can then summarize each chunk, and we can combine these partial summaries to generate a final rule set. (2) Sampling: For groups with a large number of examples, we can use representative sampling techniques to input a subset of the most informative examples, which reduces prompt size while still capturing the essential patterns needed for rule summarization. 

3. Concerning the cost of our model, please kindly see our response to weakness 3 by reviewer3, we've also attached a table of the detailed cost.

We sincerely thank the reviewer for the suggestions and below please find our response

$\underline{Response \space to \space the \space weaknesses}$

1. The advantage of our multi-step distillation process lies in enabling the model to gain a better understanding of the dataset through a few key examples and condensed rules. We respectfully argue that this approach minimizes the risk of error propagation. Unlike pipeline-based methods, where the generated rules may influence the selection of demonstrated samples (or vice versa), our approach separates the grouping and sampling processes with different methods. This independence ensures that errors in one step do not propagate to the other, allowing for a more robust and reliable distillation process. Additionally, the reflection mechanism in our approach enables the model to revisit and correct misclassified samples, providing an additional opportunity for error correction.
   
2. We acknowledge the concern of the influence of adopting different LLMs for rule summarization. Therefore, we present the experimental results with Mistral-generated and GPT-4o-mini generated rules (details and experimental results please see the response2 to reviewer2).

$\underline{Response \space to \space the \space questions}$
1. Please see my 2nd response above.
   
2. Thank you for your observation. While the easy-first strategy is designed to select the most representative instances, its purpose is not to lead to convergence on a single rule, but rather to ensure that the model can generate rules that cover the most salient patterns in the data. In our approach, the easy-first strategy helps guide the model's understanding of the broader structure of the dataset, while subsequent instances can refine or introduce new patterns. Also the reflection on the hard samples enable the model to self-improve. The generation of a single rule is not very likely, as the framework is designed to handle multiple underlying patterns and adapt as more samples are introduced.
