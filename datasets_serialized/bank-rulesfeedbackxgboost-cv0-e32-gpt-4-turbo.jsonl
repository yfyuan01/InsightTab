{"id": "bank00014", "input": "Title: Deposit subscription prediction\nThis data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.\n\nUseful patterns for the task at hand:\n1. Longer contact durations during calls are positively correlated with the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.\n2. Clients contacted fewer times in the current campaign are more likely to subscribe.\n3. Clients without personal loans are more inclined to subscribe to a term deposit.\n4. Clients contacted later in the year (e.g., August, November) show a higher likelihood of subscribing.\n5. Absence of a housing loan slightly increases the likelihood of subscription to a term deposit.\n\n###\n\n[FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES START]\n\nThe age is 46. The type of job is management.
