Both short and long periods since the last contact appear in both outcomes, indicating this feature's limited predictive power alone.\n\n14. **Number of Contacts Before This Campaign**: Generally low

Duration**: Longer contact durations do not consistently predict a positive outcome.\n11. **Number of Contacts During Campaign**: A higher number of contacts does not necessarily increase the likelihood of a subscription.\n12. **Previous Campaign Outcome**: Previous campaign outcomes like 'success' can indicate a higher likelihood of a future subscription, though data points are limited.\n13. **Days Passed Since Last Contact**: Longer periods since last contact do not show a clear trend affecting subscription likelihood.\n\n---\n\n1. **Contact Duration**: Longer contact durations tend to correlate with a higher likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.\n\n2. **Previous Campaign Outcome**: Clients with a successful outcome in previous marketing campaigns are more

year and month contacted, with some months showing higher conversion rates.\n\n12. **Account Balance**: Higher average yearly balances sometimes correlate with a higher likelihood of subscribing, though this is not always consistent.\n\n13. **Number of Contacts in Current Campaign**: Fewer contacts in the current campaign can correlate with higher subscription rates, suggesting potential over-contacting may deter potential subscribers.\n\n---\n\n1. **Previous Campaign Outcome**: Clients with a successful outcome in previous marketing campaigns are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit.\n2. **Contact Duration**: Longer last contact durations tend to correlate with a higher likelihood of subscription.\n3. **Marital Status**: Single clients show a slightly higher propensity to subscribe compared to married or divorced clients.\n4. **Age**: Younger clients (typically under 30) and older clients (typically over 50) seem more likely to subscribe.\n5. **Job Type**: Students and

**Credit in Default**: Clients without credit default are more likely to subscribe.\n8. **Housing and Personal Loans**: Clients without housing or personal loans are more likely to subscribe.\n9. **Contact Communication Type**: Clients contacted via cellular are more likely to subscribe than those contacted by other means or unknown.\n10. **Number of Contacts in Campaign**: A lower number of contacts during the campaign could correlate with a higher subscription rate, suggesting effectiveness in fewer, more targeted calls.\n11. **Balance**: Clients with higher average yearly balances tend to subscribe more, although there are exceptions.\n12. **Month of Last Contact**: Contacts made in months like March, April, and May show higher subscription rates compared to other months.\n13. **Day of Last Contact**: No clear trend, suggesting day of contact might not be a strong predictor.\n14. **Previous Contact**: Clients not previously contacted in earlier campaigns might have a fresh
