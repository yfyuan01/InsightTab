Credit default status did not show a significant impact on the decision to subscribe to a term deposit.\n\n----------------\n\n1. **Age**: No clear trend indicating that age significantly influences the decision to subscribe to a term deposit.\n\n2. **Job Type**: Clients with management, technician, and blue-collar jobs are frequent in the dataset, but no specific job type consistently correlates with term deposit subscription.\n\n3. **Marital Status**: Both single and married clients are represented, with no clear trend on the impact of marital status on subscribing to a term deposit.\n\n4. **Education**: Clients with secondary and tertiary education levels appear frequently, but there is no evident trend that higher education leads to higher subscription rates.\n\n5. **Credit in Default**: Clients who do not have credit in default are more common, suggesting a possible negative impact of having credit in default on subscribing.\n\n6. **Average Yearly Balance**: Clients with both high and low balances are represented, with no clear correlation between the balance amount and subscription likelihood.\n\n7. **Housing Loan**: Clients without housing loans appear slightly more likely to subscribe, but the trend is not strong.\n\n8. **Personal Loan**: Clients without personal loans seem to have a slightly higher subscription rate.\n\n9. **Contact Communication Type**: Cellular is the most common communication type, with no clear trend on its impact.\n\n10. **Last Contact Month**: Contacts made in different months are spread across the dataset, with no clear trend indicating a specific month being more favorable for subscriptions.\n\n11. **Last Contact Duration**: Longer contact durations appear to correlate with a higher likelihood of subscription.\n\n12. **Number of Contacts During Campaign**: Lower numbers of contacts (1-3) during the current campaign are common among those who subscribe.\n\n13. **Days Passed Since Last Contact**: Clients not previously contacted or with a long gap since the last contact show varied subscription decisions.\n\n14. **Previous Campaign Outcome**: Clients with unknown outcomes or no previous contacts are common, with a few positive responses from those with a previous campaign marked as \"failure.\"\n\n15. **Number of Contacts Before This Campaign**: Typically, clients with fewer previous contacts (0 or 1) are more frequent in the dataset, with no strong trend towards subscription likelihood.\n\n----------------\n\nTl;dr / Summarize the rules into a small set of non-conflicting and complementary patterns for predicting whether a client would subscribe to a term deposit.
