The day of the last contact within the month does not show a significant trend in influencing subscription decisions.\n\n---\n\n1. **Job Type**: Technicians and management positions show varied results, indicating job type alone may not be a strong predictor.\n\n2. **Marital Status**: Both single and married clients have subscribed and not subscribed, suggesting marital status may not be a strong determinant.\n\n3. **Education**: All clients have secondary education, making it a non-discriminatory factor in this dataset.\n\n4. **Credit in Default**: None of the clients have credit in default, thus no trend can be observed regarding default impacting subscription decisions.\n\n5. **Yearly Balance**: Clients with low or zero balances have both subscribed and not subscribed, indicating balance alone isn't a decisive factor.\n\n6. **Housing Loan**: Clients with and without housing loans have shown varied subscription behaviors.\n\n7. **Personal Loan**: Absence of personal loans in all cases who subscribed suggests potential negative impact of personal loans on subscribing.\n\n8. **Contact Type**: Cellular contact is common across all cases, not providing distinct insights.\n\n9. **Last Contact Month**: Varied results across different months; however, more successful contacts appear later in the year (August, November).\n\n10. **Last Contact Duration**: Longer durations (over 500 seconds) are common among those who subscribed, suggesting a positive correlation between longer calls and subscription likelihood.\n\n11. **Campaign Contacts**: Number of contacts in the current campaign varies, with both low and moderate contact numbers present in both outcomes.\n\n12. **Days Since Last Contact**: A shorter period since last contact (or no previous contact) does not consistently affect subscription outcomes.\n\n13. **Previous Campaign Outcome**: Previous campaign outcomes like 'unknown' and 'failure' are present in both subscribing and non-subscribing cases, indicating mixed influence.\n\n14. **Previous Campaign Contacts**: Low or zero previous contacts do not show a clear trend in affecting the current campaign's outcome.\n\n---\n\nTl;dr / Summarize the rules into a small set of non-conflicting and complementary patterns for predicting whether a client would subscribe to a term deposit. Output patterns only without any further explanations.", "llm_model": "gpt-4-turbo", "output": "1. Longer contact durations during calls are positively correlated with the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.\n2. Clients contacted fewer times in the current campaign are more likely to subscribe.\n3. Clients without personal loans are more inclined to subscribe to a term deposit.\n4. Clients contacted later in the year (e.g., August, November) show a higher likelihood of subscribing.\n5. Absence of a housing loan slightly increases the likelihood of subscription to a term deposit."}
