Clients with housing loans predominantly do not subscribe to term deposits.\n2. Clients who have not been contacted in previous campaigns generally do not subscribe to term deposits.\n3. Short last contact durations (under 300 seconds) frequently correlate with non-subscription to term deposits.\n4. Clients with low or negative average yearly balances tend to not subscribe to term deposits.\n5. Marital status does not show a clear trend affecting term deposit subscription.\n6. The type of job varies widely among clients, with no clear trend indicating a specific job type leading to higher or lower subscription rates.\n7. Clients who were contacted via cellular tend to not subscribe, although this is also the most common communication type in the data.\n8. Previous campaign outcomes labeled as \"unknown\" or \"failure\" are commonly associated with non-subscription.\n9. The number of contacts during the campaign is generally low (often 1-3 contacts) for clients who do not subscribe.\n10. The month of last contact shows a concentration in May and July, with these months typically not leading to subscriptions."}
