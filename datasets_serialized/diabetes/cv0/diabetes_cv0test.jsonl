She has a moderate triceps skin fold thickness of 13, and her glucose levels are normal at 96 after a 2-hour GTT. Her insulin levels are slightly elevated at 49, and she maintains a low body mass index of 21.1. With a moderate diabetes pedigree function score of 0.647, she has a low risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 54-year-old individual who has been pregnant 10 times. They have a diastolic blood pressure of 84 and a triceps skin fold thickness of 0. In an oral glucose tolerance test, their plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours is 162. The 2-hour serum insulin level is 0. With a body mass index of 27.7 and a diabetes pedigree function of 0.182, this individual's risk for developing diabetes may need further evaluation.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 26-year-old woman who is 1 time pregnant showed normal diastolic blood pressure and low triceps skin fold thickness. Her glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral test was low, along with zero insulin levels. She has a low body mass index and a relatively low diabetes pedigree function score.###\nHence this label was No."
"This individual is a 45-year-old woman who has been pregnant 9 times. She has a normal diastolic blood pressure of 78 and a triceps skin fold thickness of 0, indicating low body fat. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is high at 164. She has no insulin in her serum after 2 hours and has a body mass index of 32.8, which is considered obese. Her diabetes pedigree function is low at 0.148, suggesting a lower risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"This 21-year-old individual has been pregnant 3 times and has a low diastolic blood pressure of 62. They have no triceps skin fold thickness and a normal plasma glucose concentration of 111 after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Their 2-hour serum insulin level is 0, indicating low insulin production. With a body mass index of 22.6 and a low diabetes pedigree function of 0.142, this individual appears to have a relatively low risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 38-year-old woman who has been pregnant 14 times. She has a low diastolic blood pressure of 62 and a moderate triceps skin fold thickness of 30. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is elevated at 175. She has a very low 2-hour serum insulin level of 0. Despite her high glucose levels, her body mass index is in the overweight range at 33.6. The patient has a relatively low diabetes pedigree function score of 0.212, suggesting a lower genetic risk for diabetes.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 28-year-old woman who has been pregnant 3 times shows normal diastolic blood pressure and low triceps skin fold thickness. Her blood sugar level after a glucose tolerance test is below average. She has no insulin in her blood and a high body mass index. The diabetes pedigree function shows a low genetic risk for diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"This 23-year-old individual has been pregnant twice and has a diastolic blood pressure of 76. Their triceps skin fold thickness is 18, while their plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is 94. Additionally, their 2-hour serum insulin level is 66, and they have a body mass index of 31.6. Their diabetes pedigree function value is 0.649.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 23-year-old female who has never been pregnant shows normal diastolic blood pressure, moderate triceps skin fold thickness, and slightly elevated plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test. She has high insulin levels, a healthy body mass index, and a moderately low diabetes pedigree function score. Overall, she appears to have a relatively low risk of developing diabetes based on these measurements.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 27-year-old female who has been pregnant 4 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 85, triceps skin fold thickness of 27, and a plasma glucose concentration of 146 after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Her 2-hour serum insulin level is 100, and she has a body mass index of 28.9. The diabetes pedigree function score is 0.189. Overall, the patient's measurements suggest a moderate risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 32-year-old woman who has been pregnant 8 times. She has a low diastolic blood pressure of 64 and no triceps skin fold thickness. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is high at 183. She has no 2-hour serum insulin level. Despite a normal body mass index of 23.3, her diabetes pedigree function is moderately elevated at 0.672.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"The patient is a 25-year-old female who has been pregnant 2 times. She has a low diastolic blood pressure of 52 mmHg and a moderately thick triceps skin fold measuring 22 mm. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is 82 mg/dL. Additionally, her 2-hour serum insulin level is elevated at 115 \u03bcU/mL. She has a body mass index of 28.5, indicating she is overweight. The diabetes pedigree function score of 1.699 suggests a moderate genetic predisposition to diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"A young, 23-year-old individual who has been pregnant once, with normal diastolic blood pressure, a slightly below average triceps skin fold thickness, and a normal plasma glucose concentration following a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. The individual has high insulin levels, a healthy body mass index, and a low diabetes pedigree function score.###\nHence this label was No."
