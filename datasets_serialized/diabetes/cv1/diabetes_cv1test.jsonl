Their diabetes pedigree function is low at 0.453.###\nHence this label was No."
"This is a dataset for a 22-year-old individual who is pregnant for the first time. She has normal diastolic blood pressure, a moderate triceps skinfold thickness, and low plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours. Her insulin level is also relatively low. Despite having a slightly elevated body mass index, her diabetes pedigree function indicates a low risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"This is a data entry of a 29-year-old individual who has been pregnant 4 times. Their diastolic blood pressure is 66 mmHg, triceps skin fold thickness is 0 mm, and plasma glucose concentration is 110 mg/dL after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. They have a 2-hour serum insulin level of 0 \u03bcU/mL and a body mass index of 31.9 kg/m\u00b2. The diabetes pedigree function value is 0.471, indicating a genetic predisposition to diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 53-year-old female who has been pregnant 9 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 86 mmHg and a triceps skin fold thickness of 0 mm. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is 156 mg/dL. She has a 2-hour serum insulin level of 0 \u00b5U/mL and a body mass index of 24.8 kg/m\u00b2. Her diabetes pedigree function is 0.23, indicating a low genetic risk for diabetes.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"The patient is a 52-year-old who has never been pregnant. She has normal diastolic blood pressure of 72 and a low triceps skin fold thickness. Her plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is 123, and her 2-hour serum insulin level is 0. Despite having a high body mass index of 36.3, she has a low diabetes pedigree function of 0.258.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"This is a medical record of a 21-year-old individual who is 1 time pregnant. They have low diastolic blood pressure (58), no triceps skin fold thickness, and normal plasma glucose concentration (105). Their 2-hour serum insulin is 0, indicating potential risk for diabetes. However, their body mass index is within the normal range (24.3) and they have a low diabetes pedigree function (0.187).###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 25-year-old female who has been pregnant 3 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 62 and a triceps skin fold thickness of 24. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is 108, with a 2-hour serum insulin level of 0. Her body mass index is 26.0 and her diabetes pedigree function is 0.223.###\nHence this label was No."
"This patient, a 30-year-old woman, has been pregnant 4 times. She has normal diastolic blood pressure, no triceps skin fold thickness, and a slightly elevated plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test. Her insulin levels are low, and she has a high body mass index. Despite the family history of diabetes indicated by the moderately low diabetes pedigree function score, she appears to have a relatively low immediate risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"This individual is a 24-year-old who has never been pregnant. They have a diastolic blood pressure of 84 and a triceps skin fold thickness of 29. Their plasma glucose concentration is 126 after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, and their 2-hour serum insulin level is 215. With a body mass index of 30.7 and a diabetes pedigree function of 0.52, this individual's risk for developing diabetes may be worth monitoring.###\nHence this label was No."
"This patient is 23 years old with only 1 pregnancy. They have a normal diastolic blood pressure of 70 and a triceps skin fold thickness of 31. Their plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is 93, and they have a low 2-hour serum insulin level of 0. With a body mass index of 30.4, they are considered overweight. The diabetes pedigree function score is low at 0.315, indicating a lower risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 22-year-old female who is pregnant for the first time. She has normal diastolic blood pressure and a low triceps skin fold thickness. Her glucose levels after a glucose tolerance test are low, as well as her serum insulin levels. Despite that, she has a high body mass index. The diabetes pedigree function indicates a moderate genetic risk for developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 25-year-old individual who has never been pregnant and exhibits low diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, and serum insulin levels. Their plasma glucose concentration is within a normal range. Despite having a low body mass index, their diabetes pedigree function suggests a slightly elevated genetic risk for diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 21-year-old individual who has been pregnant 3 times with low diastolic blood pressure, no triceps skin fold thickness, and low insulin levels. They have a normal plasma glucose concentration, high body mass index, and a moderate diabetes pedigree function score.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 50-year-old female who has been pregnant once. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 82 and a triceps skin fold thickness of 43. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is 164, and her 2-hour serum insulin level is 67. She has a body mass index of 32.8 and a diabetes pedigree function score of 0.341. Based on these measurements, the patient's risk of developing diabetes may need to be monitored closely.###\nHence this label was No."
