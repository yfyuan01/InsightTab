Her plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in a GTT is 139 mg/dL, and her 2-hour serum insulin level is 140 \u00b5U/mL. The diabetes pedigree function, indicating genetic predisposition to diabetes, is 0.411. Overall, these measurements suggest that the patient may be at risk for developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 25-year-old woman, who has been pregnant twice, shows normal diastolic blood pressure, slightly below average triceps skin fold thickness, and low plasma glucose concentration after a GTT. Her insulin levels after 2 hours are within normal range, and she has a slightly elevated body mass index. Additionally, her diabetes pedigree function score indicates a low genetic risk for diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"This individual is 38 years old and has been pregnant 8 times. Their diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, and 2-hour serum insulin levels are all at 0. However, their plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is 120 mg/dL. They have a body mass index of 30.0 and a diabetes pedigree function value of 0.183.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"The patient is a 48-year-old female who has been pregnant 9 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 72, triceps skin fold thickness of 22, and a plasma glucose concentration of 120. Her 2-hour serum insulin level is 56, and she has a body mass index of 20.8. The diabetes pedigree function indicates a genetic predisposition towards diabetes at a value of 0.733.###\nHence this label was No."
"This is a young adult female, 23 years old, who is in her first pregnancy. She has a normal diastolic blood pressure of 76 and a relatively low triceps skin fold thickness of 34. Her glucose levels are within normal range at 89 after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, and her insulin levels are also moderate at 37. She has a slightly elevated body mass index of 31.2, indicating she may be overweight. Her diabetes pedigree function is low at 0.192, suggesting a lower genetic risk for diabetes. Overall, she appears to be in good health but may benefit from lifestyle modifications to reduce her risk of developing diabetes in the future.###\nHence this label was No."
"The individual in this dataset is a 29-year-old who has been pregnant 10 times. Their diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, and 2-hour serum insulin level are all 0. However, their plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is 115, indicating a normal glucose level. They have a body mass index of 35.3, which is considered obese. The diabetes pedigree function value is 0.134, suggesting a low genetic risk for diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 53-year-old female who has been pregnant twice. She has a low diastolic blood pressure of 70 and a high triceps skin fold thickness of 45, indicating excess body fat. Her plasma glucose concentration after a GTT is 197, which is elevated. The patient also has a high 2-hour serum insulin level of 543, suggesting possible insulin resistance. Her body mass index is 30.5, which falls in the obese category. Despite these risk factors, the patient has a relatively low diabetes pedigree function of 0.158.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 42-year-old woman, who has been pregnant 7 times, with a diastolic blood pressure of 66, no triceps skin fold thickness, a plasma glucose concentration of 114 after a glucose tolerance test, no insulin detected after 2 hours, a body mass index of 32.8, and a low diabetes pedigree function score of 0.258.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"The patient is a 58-year-old female who has been pregnant 8 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg and a triceps skin fold thickness of 34mm. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is 176 mg/dL, and her 2-hour serum insulin level is 300 \u03bcU/mL. She has a body mass index of 33.7 and a diabetes pedigree function of 0.467.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 25-year-old patient who has been pregnant twice with a diastolic blood pressure of 70, triceps skin fold thickness of 52, plasma glucose concentration of 100 after a glucose tolerance test, 2-hour serum insulin level of 57, and a body mass index of 40.5. The diabetes pedigree function is 0.677.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 22-year-old individual with low pregnancy history and low triceps skin fold thickness. They have a normal diastolic blood pressure and a slightly elevated plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test. Their insulin levels are within the normal range, and they have a healthy body mass index. The individual has a low diabetes pedigree function score, indicating a lower risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 34-year-old who has been pregnant 10 times. They have a normal diastolic blood pressure of 98 and a low triceps skin fold thickness of 0. Their plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is 115, and their 2-hour serum insulin level is 0. Despite their pregnancies, they maintain a healthy body mass index of 24.0. Additionally, they have a relatively high diabetes pedigree function score of 1.022.###\nHence this label was No."
"This is a relatively young individual who is pregnant for the first time. They have low diastolic blood pressure and their triceps skin fold thickness is moderate. Their plasma glucose concentration after a meal is normal, as is their 2-hour serum insulin level. The individual has a healthy body mass index and a moderately low diabetes pedigree function score.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 34-year-old female who has been pregnant twice. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 64 and a triceps skin fold thickness of 35. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is 106, and her 2-hour serum insulin level is 119. She has a body mass index of 30.5 and a diabetes pedigree function of 1.4.###\nHence this label was No."
