She has a slightly above-average triceps skin fold thickness of 28, but her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is within a normal range at 106. Her 2-hour serum insulin levels are elevated at 135, indicating possible insulin resistance. With a body mass index of 34.2, she is classified as obese. Her diabetes pedigree function is low at 0.142, suggesting a lower genetic risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"This individual is a 23-year-old who has never been pregnant. They have a diastolic blood pressure of 82 mmHg, a triceps skin fold thickness of 31 mm, and a plasma glucose concentration of 84 mg/dL after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Their 2-hour serum insulin level is 125 uU/ml, and their body mass index is 38.2. The diabetes pedigree function, which predicts the likelihood of developing diabetes based on family history, is 0.233.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 31-year-old woman who has been pregnant 10 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 62 and a triceps skin fold thickness of 0. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is 92, and her 2-hour serum insulin level is 0. She has a body mass index of 25.9 and a diabetes pedigree function of 0.167.###\nHence this label was No."
"This individual is a young, non-pregnant adult with low diastolic blood pressure and relatively high triceps skin fold thickness. Their plasma glucose concentration after a GTT is elevated, as is their 2-hour serum insulin level. They have a high body mass index and a relatively low diabetes pedigree function score.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"The patient is a 68-year-old woman who has been pregnant 8 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 82 and no triceps skin fold thickness. Her plasma glucose concentration is 91 after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, and her 2-hour serum insulin level is 0. She has a body mass index of 35.6 and a diabetes pedigree function of 0.587.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 52-year-old individual, who has been pregnant 5 times, with normal diastolic blood pressure and very low triceps skin fold thickness. They have high plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test, normal insulin levels, and a high body mass index. Their diabetes pedigree function is low, indicating a low genetic risk for diabetes.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"This patient is 35 years old and has been pregnant 11 times. \nTheir diastolic blood pressure is 76 and triceps skin fold thickness is 0, indicating low fat levels. \nTheir plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is 138.\n2-hour serum insulin level is 0. \nWith a body mass index of 33.2 and a low diabetes pedigree function of 0.42, this patient may have a lower risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"This patient is a young, non-pregnant individual with normal blood pressure and a healthy body mass index. They have average glucose levels and insulin levels, with a moderate triceps skin fold thickness. Their diabetes pedigree function score is low, indicating a lower risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 22-year-old female who has been pregnant twice. She has a low diastolic blood pressure of 60 and a moderate triceps skin fold thickness of 17. Her plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is normal at 98, but her 2-hour serum insulin level is high at 120. She has a high body mass index of 34.7 and a low diabetes pedigree function of 0.198. Overall, these measurements suggest a potential risk for developing diabetes due to the elevated insulin levels and high body mass index.###\nHence this label was No."
"This patient is a 38-year-old female who is pregnant for the first time. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 74 and a high plasma glucose concentration of 173. Her triceps skin fold thickness and 2-hour serum insulin levels are both at 0. With a high body mass index of 36.8 and a low diabetes pedigree function of 0.088, she may be at risk for developing diabetes in the future.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"The patient is a 41-year-old woman who has been pregnant 7 times and shows signs of high glucose levels, with a plasma glucose concentration of 184. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 84 and a high body mass index of 35.5, indicating possible obesity. Despite the high glucose levels, her insulin levels are very low at 0. With a triceps skin fold thickness of 33, she may have excess body fat. The diabetes pedigree function score of 0.355 suggests a family history of diabetes. Overall, the patient may be at risk for developing diabetes due to her high glucose levels and other associated factors.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 31-year-old woman who has never been pregnant has a slightly elevated diastolic blood pressure of 88. She has a relatively high triceps skin fold thickness of 60, indicating excess body fat. Her plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is normal at 100, but her 2-hour serum insulin level is elevated at 110. With a body mass index of 46.8, she is considered obese. Despite her family history of diabetes as indicated by a diabetes pedigree function of 0.962, she does not currently have diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"This patient is a 29-year-old female who has been pregnant 3 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 74 mmHg and a body mass index of 30.5, indicating she is overweight. Her triceps skin fold thickness and 2-hour serum insulin levels are both 0. However, her plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is high at 182 mg/dL, which could indicate a risk for developing diabetes. The diabetes pedigree function score is 0.345, suggesting a moderate genetic predisposition to diabetes.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"The patient is a 41-year-old woman who has been pregnant 12 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 85, triceps skin fold thickness of 33, and a body mass index of 37.4. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is 140. She has no serum insulin after 2 hours. Her diabetes pedigree function is 0.244.###\nHence this label was No."
"This is a 29-year-old patient who has been pregnant 6 times. Despite having a low triceps skin fold thickness of 0, they have a healthy diastolic blood pressure of 72. Their plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is 124, and their 2-hour serum insulin level is 0. With a body mass index of 27.6 and a diabetes pedigree function of 0.368, this individual's risk of developing diabetes appears to be relatively low.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"This is a data point for a 30-year-old individual who has been pregnant 6 times. They have a diastolic blood pressure of 96 and a triceps skin fold thickness of 0. Their plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is 117, with a 2-hour serum insulin level of 0. The individual has a body mass index of 28.7 and a diabetes pedigree function value of 0.157.###\nHence this label was No."
