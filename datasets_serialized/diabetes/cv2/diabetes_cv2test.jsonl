The individual has elevated plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test and a high body mass index. Their diabetes pedigree function indicates a moderate genetic risk for developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 36-year-old female who has been pregnant 3 times. She has a low diastolic blood pressure of 58 and a moderate triceps skin fold thickness of 22. Her glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is high at 174, and she has elevated serum insulin levels at 194. She also has a body mass index indicating overweight at 32.9 and a low diabetes pedigree function score of 0.593.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"This data represents a 51-year-old individual who has been pregnant 7 times. They have a diastolic blood pressure of 86, a triceps skin fold thickness of 0, and a plasma glucose concentration of 125 after a glucose tolerance test. Their 2-hour serum insulin level is 0, and they have a body mass index of 37.6. The diabetes pedigree function value is 0.304.###\nHence this label was No."
"This 29-year-old individual, who has been pregnant 3 times, shows normal diastolic blood pressure and moderate triceps skin fold thickness. Their plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is within the normal range. The 2-hour serum insulin level is also within normal limits. With a body mass index of 28.4, this person is considered overweight. Their diabetes pedigree function value suggests a moderate genetic risk for diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 42-year-old female who has been pregnant 9 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 86, a triceps skinfold thickness of 28, and a BMI of 34.3. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour GTT is 156, and her 2-hour serum insulin level is 155. She has a diabetes pedigree function of 1.189.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 36-year-old individual who has been pregnant 5 times with low diastolic blood pressure and no triceps skin fold thickness. They had a low plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours, no serum insulin, and a healthy body mass index of 25.0. Their diabetes pedigree function is 0.587, indicating a moderate genetic risk for diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 29-year-old female who has been pregnant 6 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 70 and a triceps skin fold thickness of 23. Her plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is 134, and her 2-hour serum insulin level is 130. She has a body mass index of 35.4 and a diabetes pedigree function of 0.542.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"This patient is a 21-year-old female who has been pregnant twice. She has a diastolic blood pressure reading of 0, with no measurement for triceps skin fold thickness and insulin levels. Her plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test is 84, and her body mass index is 0.0. The diabetes pedigree function score is 0.304. Overall, this patient shows some atypical values in her diagnostic measurements, which may warrant further investigation for potential risk of developing diabetes.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 25-year-old woman who has been pregnant 3 times shows signs of potential risk for diabetes, with high diastolic blood pressure, elevated triceps skin fold thickness, and a high plasma glucose concentration after a glucose tolerance test. Her insulin level is also notably high, along with a body mass index indicating obesity. Additionally, her diabetes pedigree function score suggests a genetic predisposition to the disease.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"This individual is 25 years old and has been pregnant 4 times. They have a diastolic blood pressure of 90, triceps skin fold thickness of 23, and a plasma glucose concentration of 84 after a GTT. Their 2-hour serum insulin level is 56, and they have a body mass index of 39.5. The diabetes pedigree function for this individual is 0.159.###\nHence this label was No."
"This data belongs to a 46-year-old individual who has been pregnant 12 times. Their diastolic blood pressure is 84 mmHg, triceps skin fold thickness is 33mm, plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is 100 mg/dL, and 2-hour serum insulin level is 105 \u03bcU/mL. The individual's body mass index is 30.0 kg/m\u00b2, and their diabetes pedigree function value is 0.488.###\nHence this label was No."
"This individual is a 60-year-old woman who has been pregnant 7 times. She has a diastolic blood pressure of 95, triceps skin fold thickness of 31, and a body mass index of 34.2. Her plasma glucose concentration is 179, while her 2-hour serum insulin level is 0. Her diabetes pedigree function is 0.164.###\nHence this label was No."
