"The patient is a 52-year-old male who is experiencing asymptomatic chest pain. His resting blood pressure is 135 and he has fasting blood sugar levels greater than 120 mg/dl. The resting electrocardiogram results are normal. He achieved a maximum heart rate of 128 during exercise. He also experienced exercise-induced angina. The ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest is 2.0, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment is flat.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 54-year-old female patient with atypical angina chest pain, resting blood pressure of 132, serum cholesterol of 288, fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl, probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy on resting electrocardiogram, maximum heart rate achieved at 159, experiencing exercise-induced angina, no ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, and showing an upsloping slope of the peak exercise ST segment.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 40-year-old male patient with asymptomatic chest pain, normal serum cholesterol, and resting blood pressure of 95. The patient has fasting blood sugar above 120 mg/dl, showing ST-T wave abnormality on resting electrocardiogram. With a maximum heart rate of 144 and no exercise-induced angina, the patient has a ST depression of 0.0 and an upsloping peak exercise ST segment.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 45-year-old female patient with atypical angina presented with normal resting blood pressure and high serum cholesterol levels. She had a maximum heart rate of 180 without exercise-induced angina. The ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest was 0.0, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment was upsloping. The fasting blood sugar level was below 120 mg/dl.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 55-year-old male patient with non-anginal chest pain, normal blood pressure, slightly elevated cholesterol levels, no fasting blood sugar concern, possible left ventricular hypertrophy based on ECG results, achieved a maximum heart rate of 134 without exercise-induced angina. ST depression during exercise relative to rest was 0.0, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment was upsloping.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 57-year-old male patient with asymptomatic chest pain, normal resting blood pressure, elevated serum cholesterol, no fasting blood sugar over 120 mg/dl, probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy on resting electrocardiogram, achieved a maximum heart rate of 100 without exercise-induced angina. The ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest was 0.0, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment was flat.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 62-year-old male patient with atypical angina chest pain, resting blood pressure of 120, serum cholesterol level of 281, no fasting blood sugar over 120 mg/dl, probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy on resting electrocardiogram, maximum heart rate achieved of 103, no exercise-induced angina, ST depression of 1.4 induced by exercise relative to rest, and a flat slope of the peak exercise ST segment.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 46-year-old male patient with asymptomatic chest pain, resting blood pressure of 180, serum cholesterol level of 280, normal fasting blood sugar, ST-T wave abnormality in resting electrocardiogram, maximum heart rate achieved at 120, no exercise-induced angina, no ST depression induced by exercise, and an upsloping slope of the peak exercise ST segment.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 42-year-old male with non-anginal chest pain. His resting blood pressure is 134, serum cholesterol level is 240. Fasting blood sugar is below 120 mg/dl. Resting electrocardiogram shows normal results. He achieved a maximum heart rate of 160 without exercise-induced angina. The ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest is 0.0. The slope of the peak exercise ST segment is upsloping.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 40-year-old male patient with asymptomatic chest pain, normal resting blood pressure and high serum cholesterol level. The patient has fasting blood sugar above 120 mg/dl, a normal resting electrocardiogram, and experienced exercise-induced angina. Despite this, the patient achieved a maximum heart rate of 152, with a mild ST depression of 1.0 relative to rest. The slope of the peak exercise ST segment was flat.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 47-year-old male patient with asymptomatic chest pain, resting blood pressure of 160, serum cholesterol of 291, normal fasting blood sugar, ST-T wave abnormality in resting electrocardiogram, maximum heart rate achieved at 158, experiencing exercise-induced angina, with ST depression of 3.0 relative to rest, and a flat slope of the peak exercise ST segment.###\nHence this label was Yes."
