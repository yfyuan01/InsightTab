"A 50-year-old female patient with asymptomatic chest pain, normal resting blood pressure, high serum cholesterol levels, normal fasting blood sugar, normal resting electrocardiogram results, a maximum heart rate of 110 bpm, experiencing exercise-induced angina, with 1.0 ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, and a flat slope of the peak exercise ST segment.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 70-year-old male patient with non-anginal chest pain, normal resting blood pressure, slightly elevated serum cholesterol, normal fasting blood sugar level, normal resting electrocardiogram results, achieved a maximum heart rate of 112 during exercise, experienced exercise-induced angina, showed ST depression of 2.9 induced by exercise relative to rest, and had a flat slope of the peak exercise ST segment.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 58-year-old male patient with asymptomatic chest pain, elevated resting blood pressure and high serum cholesterol. The patient has fasting blood sugar over 120 mg/dl, a normal resting electrocardiogram, and a low maximum heart rate. They do not experience exercise-induced angina. The patient shows ST depression after exercise and a downsloping peak exercise ST segment.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 37-year-old female patient with atypical angina visited the clinic. Her resting blood pressure is 120 and serum cholesterol is 260. She does not have fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl. Resting electrocardiogram results show normal findings. Her maximum heart rate achieved is 130, and she did not experience exercise-induced angina. ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest is 0.0, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment is upsloping.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 55-year-old male patient presented with atypical angina chest pain. Their resting blood pressure was 120, while their serum cholesterol level was 256. The fasting blood sugar level was above 120 mg/dl. Resting electrocardiogram results showed normal activity. The patient achieved a maximum heart rate of 137 and did not experience exercise-induced angina. ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest was 0.0, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment was upsloping.###\nHence this label was No."
"This data represents a 54-year-old male with atypical angina chest pain. His resting blood pressure is 108, serum cholesterol is 309, and fasting blood sugar is normal. Resting electrocardiogram results show normal findings. He achieved a maximum heart rate of 156 and did not experience exercise-induced angina. The ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest is 0.0, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment is upsloping.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 54-year-old male patient with non-anginal chest pain, resting blood pressure of 120, serum cholesterol level of 258, no fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl), showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy on resting electrocardiogram. The patient achieved a maximum heart rate of 147 without exercise-induced angina. ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest was 0.4, with a flat slope of the peak exercise ST segment.###\nHence this label was No."
"The patient is a 58-year-old male who is asymptomatic but has a resting blood pressure of 170. Their fasting blood sugar level is above 120 mg/dl. The resting electrocardiogram shows ST-T wave abnormality. Despite achieving a maximum heart rate of 105, the patient experiences exercise-induced angina. The ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest is 0.0, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment is flat.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 58-year-old male patient with atypical angina is observed with normal resting blood pressure of 130 and serum cholesterol level of 251. The fasting blood sugar level is below 120 mg/dl. Resting electrocardiogram shows normal results, while the maximum heart rate achieved is 110. The patient did not experience exercise-induced angina. ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest is 0.0, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment is upsloping.###\nHence this label was No."
"A 55-year-old male patient with asymptomatic chest pain, normal resting blood pressure of 172, serum cholesterol level of 260, normal fasting blood sugar, normal resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved at 73, no exercise-induced angina, 2.0 ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, and flat slope of the peak exercise ST segment.###\nHence this label was Yes."
"A 61-year-old male patient with asymptomatic chest pain, high resting blood pressure (190 mmHg), elevated serum cholesterol levels (287 mg/dl), and presence of fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl. Resting electrocardiogram indicates probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient experiences exercise-induced angina and has ST depression of 2.0 mm relative to rest. The peak exercise ST segment is downsloping, with a maximum heart rate achieved of 150 bpm.###\nHence this label was Yes."
