Higher levels of ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest are frequently associated with heart disease.\n3. A flat or downsloping slope of the peak exercise ST segment tends to indicate heart disease.\n4. Typical angina or asymptomatic chest pain types do not consistently predict heart disease without the presence of other significant factors like ST depression or exercise-induced angina.\n5. Abnormalities in the resting electrocardiogram, such as ST-T wave abnormalities or left ventricular hypertrophy, are often linked to heart disease.\n6. Higher resting blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels are often seen in patients diagnosed with heart disease, though not consistently predictive without other indicators.\n7. Older age and male sex are more frequently associated with positive heart disease findings.\n8. Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise does not show a consistent trend in predicting heart disease."}
